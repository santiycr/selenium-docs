# The Selenium Browser Automation Project

Selenium is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that
enable automation of web browsers.  Amongst other things it provides
the support infrastructure for the `W3C WebDriver specification`_,
that lets you write interchangable code for all major web browsers.

The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who have put in
thousands of hours of their own time, and made the source code freely
available under the :ref:`Apache 2.0 license <license>`.

Here is one of the simplest Selenium instructions you can make:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Firefox()
driver.get("http://google.com/?hl=en")
search_box = driver.find_element_by_id("q")
search_box.send_keys("cheese")
search_box.submit()
```

After you've installed Selenium and run this program you will see the
browser navigate to the search engine and enter “cheese” into the
search field before submitting the form.

See :doc:`quick_tour` for a full explanation of what goes on behind
the scenes when you run this code.  You should continue on to the
:ref:`narrative_documentation` to understand how you can use Selenium
as a test automation tool and to scale simple tests like this to run
in large, distributed environments on multiple browsers, under several
different operating systems.

## Getting Started

If you are new to Selenium, we have a few resources that can help you
