  h1 The Selenium Browser Automation Project

  p.
    Selenium is an umbrella project for various tools and libraries that enable
    automation of web browsers.  Amongst other things it provides the support
    infrastructure for the
    a(href='https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/webdriver/raw-file/tip/webdriver-spec.html') W3C WebDriver specification
    , that lets you write interchangable code for all major web browsers.

  p.
  The project is made possible by volunteer contributors who have put in thousands
  of hours of their own time, and made the source code freely available under the
  [Apache 2.0 license]().

  Here is one of the simplest Selenium instructions you can make:

  pre.
    from selenium import webdriver

    driver = webdriver.Firefox()
    driver.get("http://google.com/?hl=en")
    search_box = driver.find_element_by_id("q")
    search_box.send_keys("cheese")
    search_box.submit()

  After you've installed Selenium and run this program you will see the
  browser navigate to the search engine and enter “cheese” into the
  search field before submitting the form.
